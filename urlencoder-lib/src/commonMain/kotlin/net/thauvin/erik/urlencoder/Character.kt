     * Determines whether the specified character (Unicode code point) is in the supplementary character range.
     * The supplementary character range in the Unicode system falls in `U+10000` to `U+10FFFF`.
     *
     * The Unicode code points are divided into two categories:
     * Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) code points and Supplementary code points.
     * BMP code points are present in the range U+0000 to U+FFFF.
     *
     * Whereas, supplementary characters are rare characters that are not represented using the original 16-bit Unicode.
     * For example, these type of characters are used in Chinese or Japanese scripts and hence, are required by the
     * applications used in these countries.
     *
     * @returns `true` if the specified code point falls in the range of supplementary code points
     * ([MIN_SUPPLEMENTARY_CODE_POINT] to [MAX_CODE_POINT], inclusive), `false` otherwise.
